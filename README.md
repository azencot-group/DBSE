Sequential **D**isentanglement **b**y Extracting Static Information From A **S**ingle Sequence **E**lement

### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18131)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
This project presents a novel approach to unsupervised sequential disentanglement by using a simple architecture that mitigates information leakage through a subtraction inductive bias, conditioning on a single sample instead of the entire sequence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple data-modality benchmarks, simplifying the variational framework with fewer loss terms, hyperparameters, and data augmentation requirements.
